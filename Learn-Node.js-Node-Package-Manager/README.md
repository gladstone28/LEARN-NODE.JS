### Learn Node.js

**Node Package Manager**

In addition to local modules and core modules, we can take advantage of third-party modules. Using libraries created by other developers is an essential aspect of production; we don’t have to reinvent the wheel each time we want to include new functionality into our applications. NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is an online collection, or registry, of software. Developers can share code they’ve written to the registry or download code provided by other developers.

When we download Node, the npm command-line tool is downloaded as well, which enables us to interact with the registry via our terminal. There are hundreds of thousands of packages of re-usable code in the NPM registry including powerful and popular frameworks like express and react. You can explore the collection at the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/).

One package we like is [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon). It’s a powerful tool for development in Node that watches all the files in a project you’re working on, and automatically restarts your application when any of them change.
